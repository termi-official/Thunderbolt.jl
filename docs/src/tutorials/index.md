# Tutorials

On this page you find an overview of Thunderbolt tutorials.
The tutorials explain and show the indended usage of Thunderbolt to simulate cardiac problems.
Tutorials are sorted by their physical domain and written in a way that users can start with reading the tutorials (in order) of the physics they are interested in, without necessarily going through the tutorials for the other phyiscal domains.

The tutorials all follow roughly the same structure:
 - **Introduction** introduces the problem to be solved and discusses the learning outcomes
   of the tutorial.
 - **Commented program** is the code for solving the problem with explanations and comments.
 - **Plain program** is the raw source code of the program.

When studying the tutorials it is a good idea to obtain a local copy of the code and run it
on your own machine as you read along. Some of the tutorials also include suggestions for
tweaks to the program that you can try out on your own.

!!! danger
    The tutorials are work in progress and not all necessary features are implemented yet.

!!! tip
    Parallel assembly and solvers are automatically enabled when you start julia with multiple threads, e.g. via
    ```repl
    julia --project --threads=auto
    ```
