    setup_local_solve_reports(dh, lvh, ndofs_per_quadrature_point, cellset)

One report slot per quadrature point, in a single contiguous vector addressed per cell.

Each local solve writes exactly its own slot, so the store needs no counter and never grows -- which
is what makes it safe under threaded assembly. `duplicate_for_device` shares it rather than copying
it, so failures recorded by a worker remain visible to the global solver.

The flat layout is chosen with a device port in mind, but this is **not** GPU ready: nothing adapts
`DenseDataRange`, and a shared host vector is exactly what an `Adapt.adapt_structure` would have to
replace.

The per-cell quadrature point count is recovered from the [`InternalVariableHandler`](@ref), which
lays out `nqp * ndofs_per_quadrature_point` condensed unknowns per cell. `cellset` restricts the
store to the subdomain this solver serves; cells outside it get an empty range.

Dividing to recover `nqp` presumes one size for every quadrature point of the cell, the same assumption
the element layout and the local solver cache make; see [`internal_variable_size`](@ref) for the case that
breaks it.

"""
Tag for the dual numbers of the local solve -- both the Newton's Jacobian and the corrector's
derivative. It exists so the configs carrying the dual work buffers can be built once at setup
instead of once per quadrature point solve, which is what `ForwardDiff` does when it is not handed
one. The two are never active at the same time: the corrector runs after the Newton has converged.

Naming the tag rather than deriving it from the residual closure is what makes that possible: the
closure is created per quadrature point, so a tag derived from it is not available at setup. It is a
custom tag in ForwardDiff's sense, so `checktag` passes it through.

The safety this gives up -- detection of perturbation confusion under nested differentiation -- the
local solve does not have to begin with: [`GenericLocalNonlinearSolverCache`](@ref) holds `Float64`
buffers, so a dual from an outer differentiation cannot reach this Newton in the first place.

Immutable: everything that changes during a solve lives in the arrays it holds, the outer solver's

Immutability is a precondition for a device port, not a sufficient one -- the struct holds `Vector`s
and so is not `isbits`, and no `Adapt.adapt_structure` exists for it. What it buys today is that
`duplicate_for_device` can hand a worker a value rather than aliasing mutable solver state.
