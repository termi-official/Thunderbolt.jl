# These are Thunderbolt's own, deliberately: they follow the same in-package pattern as the
# continuation controllers in `homotopy.jl` -- a plain struct, a cache, and methods on
# `should_accept_step` / `adapt_dt!` / `reject_step!`.
#
# The controllers of `OrdinaryDiffEqCore` still work if asked for explicitly, but their protocol is
# not a stable interface and reads integrator fields (`success_iter`) that this integrator does not
# carry, so the *default* configuration does not depend on it.

    contraction_rate_cache(solver_cache)

The global Newton cache whose contraction rates ``\\Theta_k`` a *convergence driven* controller reads.

Two families of controller live in this package and they are driven by different things. The
[`PIDController`](@ref) below reads a local error estimate and controls the temporal accuracy. The
continuation controllers in `homotopy.jl` instead read how well Newton contracted, following
Deuflhard's affine invariant convergence theory, and control the step size so that the *nonlinear
solve* stays in its region of convergence.

The second family is useful well beyond continuation. Whenever a rate term is present only to
regularize a problem — a dashpot added so that a quasi-static solve has something to contract against
— temporal accuracy is not the quantity of interest, and controlling the Newton convergence is exactly
what is wanted. Such a controller therefore dispatches on the controller alone and asks the solver
cache for its Newton cache here, rather than being tied to one time scheme.

A cache with no meaningful contraction rate — a linear stage, which converges in one step by
construction — deliberately has no method, so the mismatch surfaces as a missing method naming the
cache instead of an invented rate.

    PIDController(β₁, β₂, β₃ = 0; accept_safety = 0.81, limiter = default_dt_factor_limiter)

Proportional-integral-derivative step size control from a local error estimate, following
Söderlind [Sod:2003:dcs](@cite).

With ``\varepsilon_i`` the inverse of the scaled error estimate of the last three steps, the step size
factor is
```math
\texttt{dt\_factor} = \mathrm{limiter}\left(
\varepsilon_1^{\beta_1/k}\, \varepsilon_2^{\beta_2/k}\, \varepsilon_3^{\beta_3/k} \right) ,
\qquad k = \texttt{adaptive\_order} + 1 ,
```
and the next step is `Δt * dt_factor`. Dividing the exponents by `k` is why the coefficients are
stated independently of the scheme's order, unlike a bare PI controller.

Two details do most of the work in practice, and both differ from a textbook I-controller:

* a step is accepted when the **proposed factor** clears `accept_safety`, not when the error estimate
  clears one. A noisy estimate landing just above unity then costs a slightly shorter next step
  instead of a discarded one.
* the default limiter ``1 + \arctan(x - 1)`` is smooth and saturates around `[0.21, 2.57]`, so no
  separate `qmin`/`qmax` clipping is needed and the response to an outlier is gentle.

`benchmarks/benchmark-newmark-controllers.jl` measures the coefficients against a pure integral and a
PI setting, and checks the `tol^(-1/3)` step count law that pins the estimate's order.

The defaults `(0.6, -0.2, 0)` are Söderlind's, and are what [`NewmarkSolver`](@ref) uses unless a
controller is passed to `init`.
