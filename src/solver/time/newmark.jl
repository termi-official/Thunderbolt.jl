    NewmarkSolver(; β, γ, inner_solver, system_matrix_type, monitor)

Newmark-β integration of the second order system ``M \ddot{u} + f_\mathrm{int}(u) = f_\mathrm{ext}``.

Given ``(u_n, v_n, a_n)`` the scheme forms the predictors
```math
\tilde{u} = u_n + \Delta t\, v_n + (\tfrac12 - \beta)\Delta t^2 a_n , \qquad
\tilde{v} = v_n + (1 - \gamma)\Delta t\, a_n
```
and solves the balance of momentum at ``t_{n+1}`` for the **displacement**, with
```math
a(u) = \frac{u - \tilde{u}}{\beta \Delta t^2} , \qquad v(u) = \tilde{v} + \gamma \Delta t\, a(u) .
```
The nonlinear solver therefore sees the residual and tangent
```math
r(u) = M a(u) + f_\mathrm{int}(u) - f_\mathrm{ext} , \qquad
J(u) = K(u) + \frac{1}{\beta \Delta t^2} M .
```

!!! note "Displacement form, not acceleration form"
    Textbooks usually solve the *acceleration* form, whose effective mass matrix
    ``M + \beta \Delta t^2 K`` is constant and can be factorized once. That relies on `K` being
    constant, which is true for linear elasticity and false for every material in this package. With
    a nonlinear internal force the unknown has to be the quantity the material is a function of. For
    a linear material the two forms are the same system scaled by ``\beta\Delta t^2``.

The defaults ``\beta = 1/4``, ``\gamma = 1/2`` are the average acceleration rule: unconditionally
stable, second order, and energy conserving. ``\gamma > 1/2`` adds numerical dissipation and drops
the scheme to first order.

Error tolerances are `init` keywords (`reltol`, `abstol`) as everywhere else in SciML, not fields
here.

Damping is not supported yet; the model is `M ü + f_int(u) = f_ext`.

    NewmarkStageOperator

The nonlinear operator of one Newmark stage: the internal force operator plus the inertia
contribution the time scheme adds on top of it.

This is the only place that knows the scheme's coefficients. It delegates to the wrapped operator for
`f_int`/`K` and then adds `M a(u)` to the residual and `M/(βΔt²)` to the linearization, so the
nonlinear solver keeps seeing a plain operator.

`M` and `K` are assembled separately and recombined rather than fused into one element loop. That is
the same choice [`BackwardEulerAffineODEStage`](@ref) makes, and it is what keeps a change of `Δt`
cheap — the mass matrix is constant, only its scalar weight moves.

The velocity and acceleration the scheme reconstructed.

The velocity is a field of the solution vector and could also be read out of it directly; these
accessors exist because the *interpolated* velocity at an interior `t` is not something a consumer can
assemble by hand. The acceleration has no block of its own -- it is determined by the state rather
than part of it -- so this is the only way to reach it.

**Pass the time whenever the solution is read at a chosen time rather than at a step boundary.**
`TimeChoiceIterator` and `intervals` interpolate `u` to the requested `t` but leave the integrator
sitting at the end of the step that bracketed it, so the no-argument form returns a velocity from a
*different* time than the `u` handed to the loop body:

```julia
for (u, t) in TimeChoiceIterator(integrator, 0.0:dtvis:tend)
    v = velocity(integrator, t)      # matches `u`
    v_wrong = velocity(integrator)   # the end of the bracketing step

!!! note "Accuracy"
    The displacement and the velocity come from the cubic Hermite interpolant through `(u, v)` at both
    step ends, which is second order and consistent with the update formulas -- in particular the
    velocity returned is the derivative of the displacement returned. The acceleration is that
    interpolant's second derivative, which is linear in the step and therefore only an approximation

Inserting the corrector ``v = \tilde{v} + \gamma\Delta t\,(u - \tilde{u})/(\beta\Delta t^2)`` into
``v(u) = \partial_u v\,(u - u_v)`` and collecting terms gives ``u_v = \tilde{u} - \tilde{v}/\partial_u v``.
The element then forms the rate from the *same* two ingredients backward Euler uses, and needs to know

The discretization one Newmark step hands the elements.

The two time quantities stay apart. `Δt` is the interval the internal variable integrates over —

reconstructed as ``v(u) = \partial_u v\,(u - u_v)``. Under Newmark the two differ by
``\gamma/\beta``, and `weights` is what carries the reconstruction slope into the scheme matrix.

    _newmark_report_error!(integrator, cache, Δt, β)

Local error estimate of Zienkiewicz and Xie [ZieXie:1991:sae](@cite),

```math
e_{n+1} = \Delta t^2 \left( \beta - \tfrac{1}{6} \right) \left( a_{n+1} - a_n \right) ,
```

scaled into the usual `EEst ≤ 1` convention against `abstol + reltol·max(|u_{n+1}|, |u_n|)` and handed
to the controller with [`set_error_estimate!`](@ref).

It compares the Newmark update against the third order accurate one obtained with ``\beta = 1/6``, so
the difference of the two accelerations across the step is the whole estimate. Since
``a_{n+1} - a_n = O(\Delta t)``, the estimate is ``O(\Delta t^3)`` — the local error of a second order
scheme, which is what makes `alg_adaptive_order = 2` correct.

!!! note "Why no second right hand side evaluation"
    In the first order `(v, u)` formulation the acceleration is not part of the state, so an
    implementation there has to evaluate the right hand side again at the new state to recover it. The
    displacement form does not: the converged Newton *is* the statement
    `M a_{n+1} = f_ext - f_int(u_{n+1})`, so `aₙ` already holds that acceleration to solver tolerance
    and the estimator is free.

    An estimator formed from the solved acceleration and a fresh right hand side evaluation at the
    same state is identically zero, so the estimate has to straddle the step.

`β = 1/6` makes the estimator vanish identically, which is correct — that is the member of the family
the estimate is taken against — but it leaves the scheme with no error estimate.
