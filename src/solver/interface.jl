    setup_assembled_operator(strategy, integrator, system_matrix_type, dh)

Materialize `integrator` against `dh` into the operator a solver requesting `system_matrix_type` can
step with.

The device that assembles and the format the solver wants its system matrix in are independent
choices -- the model carries `strategy`, the solver carries `system_matrix_type` -- and this is where
they meet. Where both live on the host they may still differ in *format*: the affine backward Euler
stage reads the mass and diffusion matrices only through `nonzeros`, and every host allocator emits
the same ordering for one dof handler, so the requested format is simply not needed here. Across a
device boundary that no longer holds, and the extension method returns a
[`MirroredBilinearOperator`](@ref) instead.

Where the strategy names a *device*, there is no mirror: the operator assembles straight into
`system_matrix_type`, so the format is threaded onto the operator specification and the two knobs
have to name the same one. Device assembly needs a CSC device matrix -- Ferrite ships no device
assembler for CSR, so `FerriteOperators` rejects that pairing at setup -- and a CSR system matrix
stays available only through a *host* assembly strategy, which assembles on the host and mirrors
into the device matrix.

    MirroredBilinearOperator(host_operator, A)

A bilinear operator assembled by `host_operator` on the host, whose matrix is mirrored into `A`.

`update_operator!` runs the host assembly and then refreshes `A`, so everything downstream --
`mul!`, and the `nonzeros` the affine backward Euler stage combines -- sees only `A`. That
correspondence is entrywise, so `A` has to be allocated by the same [`create_system_matrix`](@ref)
call as the stage matrix it is combined into; nothing here can check that beyond the entry count.

The real precondition is stronger than the entry count, and the constructor cannot see the
difference: the mirror copies `nonzeros` positionally, so the two matrices must ALSO agree on the
ORDER their nonzeros are stored in. A host CSR and a device CSC of the same pattern have the same
`nnz` and pass the check; they carry the same order only because `ThreadedSparseMatrixCSR` is the CSR
of the TRANSPOSE and therefore shares the CSC ordering of the original, and because the forms
mirrored this way are symmetric, so that transpose is the same matrix. An ASYMMETRIC form mirrored
across that pairing would be silently transposed. Mirror a CSR host matrix only where both hold.

The operator the stage of `solver` solves with, for the function `f`.

Dispatches on the **pair**, because what is assembled and which dof handler it is assembled against
are both properties of the combination: a continuation poses the internal forces alone, backward Euler
poses them with a condensed local problem underneath, and Newmark poses them together with an inertia
term. Each method therefore names its own handler; nothing infers one from `f`.

Distinct from the `setup_operator(strategy, integrator, dh)` family, which materializes one integrator
against one handler and knows nothing about who will solve with it.

`local_solver_cache` is the per-quadrature-point scratch from [`setup_local_solver_cache`](@ref), or
`nothing` where nothing is condensed. `t₀` is the time any operator that has to be assembled once at
setup is assembled at.
