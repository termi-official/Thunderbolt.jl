    InternalVariableEvolution

Holy trait classifying the evolution law of a condensed internal variable `Q`, and with it the class
of the resulting system:

| trait                  | local problem per quadrature point | resulting system        |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| `NoEvolution`          | none — no condensed unknown at all  | rate free               |
| `SteadyStateEvolution` | algebraic `0 = L(F, Q)`             | rate free               |
| `FirstOrderEvolution`  | `dₜQ = L(F, Q)`                     | ODE in mass matrix form |
| `RateCoupledEvolution` | `dₜQ = L(F, dₜF, Q)`                | true DAE                |

The first two rows are both rate free but are *not* interchangeable: `NoEvolution` means there is
nothing to condense, `SteadyStateEvolution` means there is a local problem to solve that happens to
carry no time derivative. They therefore select different element caches, and only the second needs a
local solver.

Note what separates `SteadyStateEvolution` from `FirstOrderEvolution`, since the names in the cache
hierarchy invite the opposite reading: `RateIndependentCondensationMaterialStateCache` means "`L`
does not read `dₜF`", not "no rate at all", and its local problem still needs a timestep.

This is a property of the *model*, deliberately not of the state cache it is lowered into. The
`Empty…CondensationMaterialStateCache` types say only that a model needs no extra scratch space for
its evaluation; they say nothing about whether it carries an internal variable or how that variable
evolves. Reading the classification off them conflates the two questions.

It is also askable before a mesh exists, which the cache-based answer is not — and that is what lets
a solver reject an incompatible model during setup rather than from the assembly loop.

"""
    is_coupling_model(model) -> Bool

Capability trait: does `model` describe a *coupling* between existing fields rather than a physics
domain of its own?

A coupling model attaches to field variables introduced by other models - typically across an
interface between subdomains - and therefore does not own a block of the solution vector the way a
bulk model does. `InterfaceDiffusionModel` is the current example.

This is deliberately independent of [`has_pointwise_reaction_part`](@ref): the two answer different
questions, and a coupling model may well carry its own reaction dynamics (e.g. gap-junction
kinetics on an interface). Code deciding *whether a model owns a domain block* must ask this trait,
not infer it from the presence or absence of a reaction part.
"""

"""
    get_time(p)

The time carried by an assembly parameter object.

Assembly routines receive whatever the time scheme handed the element, and *what* that is depends on
the scheme: continuation passes the bare pseudo-time, backward Euler a
`FerriteOperators.GenericFirstOrderTimeElementParameters`, Newmark a [`NewmarkElementParameters`](@ref).
Anything that needs the time — a coefficient evaluation, most often — asks for it here instead of
assuming the trailing argument *is* the time.

Asking rather than assuming is what lets one parameter object serve caches with different needs. It
has to: FerriteOperators computes a single object from the volumetric cache and passes that same
object to the boundary cache, so a spring wanting the time and a dashpot wanting the velocity (see
[`facet_velocity`](@ref)) have to coexist behind it.

The fallback treats an unrecognized object as the time itself, which is what makes the bare
`assemble_element!(…, 0.0)` calls throughout the tests and the linear/bilinear operators keep working.
