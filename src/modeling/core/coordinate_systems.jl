Recalibrate the apicobasal Laplace field `u` (0 on the apex, 1 on the base, natural boundary

Along a trajectory of `u` we have `ds = du/‖∇u‖`, so the arc length from level `u` to the base is

`ab` is monotone in `u`, so `∇ab ∥ ∇u` and the chart can never reverse orientation through the
apicobasal coordinate. It is exactly 0 on the apex Dirichlet set and exactly 1 on the base on every
mesh, so different anatomies agree on where the ends of the coordinate are. The recalibration is
what makes it usable: the raw harmonic field bunches severely, since pinning `u = 0` at the apex is

    compute_lv_coordinate_system(mesh::SimpleMesh)

Compute the transmural, apicobasal and rotational coordinates of a left ventricle.

Requires a mesh with facetsets
    * Base
    * Epicardium
    * Endocardium
and the two internal facetsets marking the lines along which the right ventricle attaches
    * SRidgeAnt
    * SRidgePost
which the idealized generators emit and the ridge extraction of a segmented anatomy produces.

Every one of those is a keyword, so a mesh that names its annotations differently needs no renaming.

# The apical end of the apicobasal coordinate, and why it is still a nodeset

By default it is pinned on `apex_nodeset`. **That is known to be wrong, and is kept only because the
alternative currently on offer is worse.** A point or a pair of points has zero H¹-capacity in 3D, so
it does not constrain the solution in any neighbourhood: on an idealized ventricle the field jumps
from 0 at the apex node straight to 0.687 at its neighbours, leaving two thirds of the coordinate
range carrying no dofs at all for [`apicobasal_from_laplace`](@ref) to integrate over. The visible
consequence is that the coordinate at a fixed physical point is *not* mesh independent -- it moves by
up to 0.27 between resolutions, non-monotonically.

`apical_cap_fraction > 0` pins an apical cap instead: the endocardial and epicardial facets within
that fraction of the chamber length of the apex, measured along the long axis. A surface has positive
capacity, and it works as advertised for the coordinate -- the empty range collapses from 136 bins to
6 and the drift at a fixed midwall point from 0.27 to 0.011. `apex_facetset` pins an annotated cap
instead of deriving one.

**It is not the default because it destroys the local frame under the cap.** Pinning the coordinate
on a wall-parallel surface makes that surface a level set, so `∇apicobasal ∥ ∇transmural` there, and
[`evaluate_coordinate_axes`](@ref) orthogonalizes one against the other -- what survives is
round-off. Measured on the idealized ventricle, the frame's worst orthonormality deviation goes from
2e-15 to 0.84. That frame is what the microstructure is built on, so the cap trades a coordinate that
is wrong by 0.27 for fibers that are wrong at the apex.

Note the endocardium contributes nothing here: on a truncated ellipsoid it has no facets within 10%
of the apex, so the derived cap is epicardial whether or not the endocardium is offered.

The fix this is waiting for is a pinned surface **transverse** to the wall -- an internal disc near
the apex, which is what a level set of the coordinate actually looks like there -- rather than one
parallel to it. Failing that, two fields: the nodeset-pinned one for the frame, whose gradient is
sound everywhere, and a capped one for the value.

The coordinates are

  * `transmural`: 0 on the endocardium, 1 on the epicardium.
  * `apicobasal`: 0 at the apex, 1 at the base, parametrized by arc length, see
    [`apicobasal_from_laplace`](@ref).
  * `rotational`: the Cobiveco chart, 0 on the posterior ridge, 2/3 on the anterior ridge and back
    to 1 at the posterior ridge through the septum. Anchored on the ridges rather than on the
    orientation of the mesh in space, which is what makes it comparable between hearts.

Meshes without ridges fall back to the plain azimuth around the long axis. That is *not* the same
chart -- it distributes the coordinate by angle rather than by the position of the right ventricular
insertions -- so two hearts only agree under it if they are aligned the same way in space. Pass
`ridge_anterior = ridge_posterior = nothing` to ask for it deliberately.
