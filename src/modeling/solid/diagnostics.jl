# Kinematic diagnostics for solid mechanics solves.
#
# Two failure modes motivate these, and neither one announces itself.
#
# *Element inversion.* A hyperelastic energy is only a model of the material on `det F > 0`, and
# several of the compressibility penalties in `energies.jl` are written in `I₃ = det(C) = (det F)²`,
# which cannot see the sign of `det F` at all — so the folded configuration is an equally admissible
# minimum as far as Newton is concerned. A solve that folds an element does not fail; it converges.
#
# *Drift along a null space of the tangent.* A body held only by boundary conditions that leave some
# rigid motion free — a `NormalSpringBC`, which resists the normal displacement but not tangential
# sliding — can rotate at no energy cost. That too converges, and `det F` stays exactly 1 while the
# displacement grows without bound. Only comparing the displacement gradient against the *strain*
# separates "the body moved" from "the body deformed", which is why both are reported.

    DeformationGradientReport

Summary of the kinematics of a solve over its quadrature points, as produced by
[`deformation_gradient_report`](@ref).

* `n_nonpositive > 0` — the configuration is folded, and no amount of solver convergence makes it a
  valid deformation.
* `max_deviation` large with `max_strain` near zero — the body is moving rigidly rather than
  deforming, which is the signature of a solve sliding down a null space of the tangent.

`n_subdomains` is how many `SubDofHandler`s actually contributed. It is worth checking on a
multiphysics or mixed-dimensional problem, where the ones carrying no displacement field are skipped.

    deformation_gradient_report(f, u; qr_order = 2)
    deformation_gradient_report(dh::Ferrite.AbstractDofHandler, u, fields; qr_order = 2)

Kinematic summary of the configuration `u`: the range of ``\det \bm{F}``, how many quadrature points
are folded, and how far the body has moved (``\max \lVert \bm{F} - \bm{I} \rVert``) against how much it
has actually strained (``\max \lVert \bm{E} \rVert``).

The first form takes a semidiscrete function and reads the displacement symbols off its model. The
second takes them explicitly, as a `Symbol` or a collection of them, which is what to use for a bare
`DofHandler` or when the field to differentiate is not the one the model would name.

Only subdomains carrying one of `fields` are visited, so a multiphysics handler -- mechanics next to
electrophysiology, or a mixed-dimensional grid with a Purkinje network -- reports on its mechanical
part alone. A subdomain whose displacement field cannot yield a square ``\bm{F}`` (an embedded shell
or cable, where the reference dimension differs from the component count) is skipped for the same
reason: ``\det \bm{F}`` is not defined there. `n_subdomains` on the result says how many contributed,
and it is an error for that to be zero.

Reach for this when a solve "converges" to something implausible, and especially when a mechanics
problem diverges only for *some* inputs -- a perturbed microstructure, a different step size. That
pattern usually means the solve is finding a fold or a free rigid mode rather than meeting a genuinely
harder problem, and neither is visible in the residual.

`qr_order` need not match the quadrature the solve used; this samples the field, it does not integrate
it.
