    RateDependence

Whether a material's stress depends on the deformation *rate* `Ḟ` in addition to `F`.

A [`RateDependent`](@ref) material implements the five-argument
`stress_and_tangent(model, F, Ḟ, coefficients, state)`, returning `(P, ∂P∂F, ∂P∂Ḟ)`. The element
assembles

    dP/du = ∂P/∂F ⋅ ∂F/∂u + ∂P/∂Ḟ ⋅ ∂Ḟ/∂u

where `∂Ḟ/∂u` comes from the *time scheme* (`1/Δt` for backward Euler, `γ/(βΔt)` for Newmark), so a
material never learns how the rate was formed. A material must not difference `F` against a previous
value itself: that bakes one time discretization into the constitutive law.

answers for it with a zero rate tangent.

This is the argument `material_routine` takes in place of a bare `F`. Below that seam the material
functions (`stress_and_tangent`, `stress_function`, `Ψ`) keep taking bare tensors, so the automatic

Offering more than a material reads is fine: a [`RateIndependent`](@ref) material accepts

The SDIRK row is why both factors are carried rather than just the rate one: solving for the stage

Both factors come from [`KinematicLinearization`](@ref), so the material never learns how the rate
was formed. They are scalars, so this collapses to one tensor add per quadrature point, outside the
test function loops.

Folding here is right for a single-stage scheme, which needs one matrix. A fully implicit
Runge-Kutta scheme must **not** fold: it recombines the same two contributions with ``s^2`` different
weights ``\Delta t\, a_{ij}``, so it consumes the [`AbstractKinematicSensitivities`](@ref) directly
and assembles the two parts separately. That is why `material_routine` returns them unfolded.

    RateTypeCondensationMaterialStateCache

Every condensation cache whose local problem carries a time derivative, i.e. `dₜQ = L(F, Q)` or
`dₜQ = L(F, dₜF, Q)`. Both need a timestep and a known state, which is what separates them from
the rate-free caches used by continuation solvers.

## The `(Qknownflat, Δt)` contract

Every local solve below poses the same problem,
```math
(Q - Q_{\textrm{known}}) / \Delta t = L(F, Q)
```
and **both arguments are effective quantities the caller normalizes**. `Qknownflat` is deliberately
not called `Qprev`: for anything past backward Euler it is a linear combination of history, not a
previous value.

| scheme | ``Q_{\textrm{known}}`` | ``\Delta t`` |
| :----- | :--------------------- | :----------- |
| backward Euler | ``Q_n`` | ``\Delta t`` |
| BDF-``k`` | ``-\frac{1}{\alpha_0}\sum_{j\geq 1}\alpha_j Q_{n+1-j}`` | ``\Delta t/\alpha_0`` |
| DIRK stage ``i`` | ``Q_n + \Delta t \sum_{j<i} a_{ij} L_j`` | ``a_{ii}\Delta t`` |
| Newmark | ``Q_n`` | ``\Delta t`` |

So one local solver serves all four: the scheme's order and stage structure live entirely in how the
caller computes these two values, exactly as the kinematics seam keeps the rate's provenance out of
the material. A fully implicit Runge-Kutta scheme is the exception — its stages are genuinely
coupled, so it needs a local solver over all ``s`` stages at once rather than this one.

    PrestressedMechanicalModel(inner_model, prestress_field)

Models the stress formulated in the 1st Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor based on a multiplicative split
of the deformation gradient $$F = F_{\textrm{e}} F_{0}$$ where we compute $$P(F_{\textrm{e}}) = P(F F^{-1}_{0})$$.

Please note that it is assumed that $$F^{-1}_{0}$$ is the quantity computed by `prestress_field`.

The inner model's strain energy is taken per unit volume of the **intermediate** (stress-free)
configuration, so the referential density is $$\\Psi(F) = \\det(F_0)\\, \\Psi^e(F F_0^{-1})$$ and the
first Piola stress carries the $$\\det(F_0)$$ factor. For isochoric prestress this coincides with the
per-reference-volume convention; for non-isochoric fields (e.g. kinematic growth) it does not.

Rate-coupled form of the sarcomere local solve, `dₜQ = L(F, dₜF, Q)`.

The internal variable now responds to the stretch *and* to its rate, so there are two corrector
solves, ``\partial Q/\partial\lambda`` and ``\partial Q/\partial\dot\lambda``. They combine into the
two sensitivities the element asks for by the chain rule through
``\dot\lambda = (\partial\lambda/\partial F) : \dot F``:
```math
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial \dot F} = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial \dot\lambda}\otimes\frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial F}
```
```math
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial F} =
  \frac{\partial Q}{\partial \lambda}\otimes\frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial F}
+ \frac{\partial Q}{\partial \dot\lambda}\otimes\left(\frac{\partial^2 \lambda}{\partial F^2} : \dot F\right)
```
`∂Q/∂Ḟ` is exact because ``\lambda`` is a function of ``F`` alone, so ``\dot\lambda`` is *linear* in
``\dot F`` with coefficient ``\partial\lambda/\partial F``.

**The second term of `∂Q/∂F` is not optional.** ``\dot\lambda`` varies with ``F`` too, through the
curvature of ``\lambda``, and that term is the same order as the first. Dropping it leaves a
descent direction rather than a Newton direction: measured on the contracting cuboid, the global
residual then falls by a factor of only ~0.6 per iteration and stalls six orders short of the
tolerance. It is why this method takes the Hessian of ``\lambda`` where the rate-free one takes only
its gradient.

    internal_variable_size(model, cid, qp) -> Int

How many values of quadrature-point-local state one quadrature point of `model` carries.

**This is not a constant in general**, which is why it takes the cell and the quadrature point rather than
the model alone. A model that solves a nested boundary value problem per quadrature point -- FE² and
computational homogenization generally -- sizes its local state by that problem's dof count, and that
differs from point to point. Such a model implements this method directly and ignores the default below.

The default *is* constant: it sums [`gather_internal_variable_infos`](@ref), which is fixed by the model
type, and therefore folds to a literal. Every material in the package today takes that route, and the
assembly path relies on it -- see the callers that pass `nothing, nothing` and the note on
[`InternalVariableHandler`](@ref) storage. Making a genuinely per-point size work needs those call sites
and the storage layout to carry the variation too; the signature is what keeps that door open.
