The unknowns the model's facet terms need beyond the displacement field, in `facet_models` order.

`DofHandler`.

Returns the displacement symbol of a (possibly multi-domain) structural model, i.e. either a single

Errors if a multi-domain model does not agree on a single displacement symbol across all subdomains.

Balance of momentum including the inertia term,

+ \int_\Omega \mathrm{grad}(\delta u) : P(u) \,\mathrm{d}\Omega = \text{(facet terms)} ,
```
i.e. the [`QuasiStaticModel`](@ref) with a mass term on top.

!!! note "The velocity is a field, but not a Newton unknown"
    `velocity_symbol` names a genuine field: it shares the displacement's interpolation, occupies a
    block of the solution vector, and can be written out by name. What it is *not* is an unknown of
    the nonlinear solve, and a `Dirichlet` condition on it is refused -- a scheme that reconstructs
    the velocity from the displacement would overwrite whatever the constraint wrote. Time integrators for this model (see
    [`NewmarkSolver`](@ref)) discretize in displacement form, so a step solves for the displacement
    and reconstructs the velocity from it. The acceleration is not stored either way: it follows from
    the balance of momentum.
