# Named access to the solution vector.
#
# A semidiscrete function answers `solution_variables(f)` with the named quantities its solution vector
# holds. Everything user-facing -- initial conditions, post-processing, IO -- is built on that one method,
# so no consumer has to know how a particular function type lays out its unknowns.

# GPU kernel. They are deliberately not type stable.

`state_range` returns a `StepRange` rather than a `UnitRange` because a point's states are contiguous
under a point-blocked layout but strided under a state-blocked one. Consumers index the result
(`state_range(points, k)[c]`) instead of doing arithmetic themselves, which is what lets the same code
serve both layouts, ragged quadrature-point state, and discretizations in which the state points bear no
relation to any field's dofs.

descriptor.

`components` selects which slots of a point's local state vector this variable owns. It is not always
all of them and not always contiguous: an electrophysiology cell state excludes the transmembrane
potential, which is a field, and `ParametrizedAlievPanfilovModel` carries that potential at index 2 of 2.
