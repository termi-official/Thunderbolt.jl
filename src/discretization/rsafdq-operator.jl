    _chamber_coupling(displacement_symbol, chamber)

The sparsity the chamber pressure needs, as Ferrite's coupling descriptor.

The pressure is the facet items' own tail (`facet_item_global_dofs`), so the only local systems it
enters are the tying facets': `FacetCoupling` over the chamber surface allocates the displacement
dofs of the adjacent cells and nothing beyond them. The cell sweep of those subdomains assembles the
pure displacement system and never addresses a pressure entry.
