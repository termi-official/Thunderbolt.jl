    semidiscretize(model, discretization, mesh)

Transform a space-time model into a pure time-dependent problem.

The result is a semidiscrete *function* describing the spatial discretization. Which concrete
function type comes out depends on the model, on the discretization, and on any annotation wrapping
the model (e.g. [`ReactionDiffusionSplit`](@ref)).

## Implementing a new model

There is deliberately no common model supertype - a model is whatever implements the interface, so
that types owned by other packages can act as models too. At minimum a model needs

  - [`get_field_variable_names`](@ref) - the field variables it introduces, as a `Tuple` of `Symbol`
  - `get_volumetric_weak_form_names` - the volumetric weak forms it contributes, as a `Tuple`
  - a `semidiscretize` method

and, if it carries quadrature-point-local state, [`gather_internal_variable_infos`](@ref). A model
whose terms introduce unknowns outside the mesh also implements [`algebraic_variables`](@ref); the
discretization puts what it declares into the `DofHandler`.
