module ThunderboltKernelAbstractionsExt

# The struct-of-arrays half of FerriteOperators' GPU device seam for Thunderbolt's element caches:
# `setup_device_instances` batches a cache over the workers once at setup, `device_worker_view`
# slices worker `w`'s out of that batch inside the assembly kernel. A cache author writes the pair,
# naming which fields batch and which are shared.
#
# The trigger stands for "FerriteOperators carries the device seam" -- the same condition that
# activates its own KernelAbstractions extension, and the version gate for `device_worker_view`,
# which FerriteOperators 0.4 does not have.

# triggers this extension and fails on the import below before any code here runs, for every CUDA
# user regardless of whether they touch the device seam. Everything that names it, the import
# included, is gated on the newer surface being present. The module import must precede the guard:
# an `import FerriteOperators: name` binds only that name, never the module the guard inspects.

    The device-resident handler a device geometry cache is built from, for a handler whose grid is a
    [`SimpleMesh`](@ref).

    Ferrite's own rule builds a `FerriteKAExt.HostDofHandler`, whose grid field is declared
    `G <: Ferrite.Grid{sdim}` -- so it takes no other `AbstractGrid`, and a `SimpleMesh` backed handler
    is a `MethodError` there even though every accessor it uses forwards. Relaxing that bound to
    `AbstractGrid{sdim}` upstream removes this method; until then the handler is rebuilt over the mesh's
    own `Grid`, which carries the same cells and nodes in the same order.

    The rebuild redistributes the dofs, so it asserts that it reproduced the numbering the operator's
    matrix is indexed by. A device assembly against a handler that numbered differently would scatter
    into the wrong rows, which no later check would catch.
